# MAGIC-Fishodoro #

Fishodoro is a gamified study tool based on the Pomodoro study technique to help users be more productive and healthy with their study techniques. In addition to the timer, the app features helpful tools like a to-do list to keep users on track, and as users check tasks off their to-do list, they gain coins that they can use to customize their very own calming study environment; a fish pond!

This app in currently being developed using the Unity Engine, with both 2D and 3D art aspects to create a cute and relaxed aesthetic so users aren't distracted. Stay tuned for updates!
